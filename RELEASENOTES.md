# Release Notes

## 0.7.0.0 - 2023-05-XX

### Meridian Window Support
This release adds support for restricting target imaging to a timespan around the target's meridian crossing in order to minimize airmass and light pollution impacts.

A new rule for the Scoring Engine lets you set the priority of targets using meridian windows so they can be prioritized if desired.

### New Profile Preferences

* Option to park the mount when the planner is waiting for the next target.
* Option to throttle exposure counts when not using image grading.
* Option to accept all improvements in star count and/or HFR during image grading.


### Miscellaneous

* Added airmass to acquired image data detail display.
* Fixed problem with ROI exposure capture.
* Fixed problem with including rejected exposure plans.
* Fixed bug causing crashes during plan previews.
